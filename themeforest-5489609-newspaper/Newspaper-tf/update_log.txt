This is very useful to customize the layout of pages added by plugins that use Custom Post Types. Want a new sidebar with custom widgets on that custom post type? Boom! it can be done now. Ok we found that some of the plugins register custom post types and use the page template, instead of the single template, if that's the case we recommend that you take one of the single templates and rename it to single-plugins_custom_post_type.php. You can generally find the custom post type used by the plugin via our CPT panel.
